## Introduction

WildFly Galleon Plugins project includes Galleon and Maven plugin implementations that are dedicated to building feature-packs (including generation of feature specs and packages) for WildFly releases and also provisioning of the WildFly-based distributions. These plugins can also be re-used by projects that integrate into or extend WildFly.
