#### Generating JBoss module packages

The current approach is to generate a package per JBoss module. JBoss module dependencies are reflected in the corresponding package dependencies.

To generate JBoss module packages the resources directory of the project has to include `modules/system/layers` directory which contains `module.xml` file templates.

Traditionally, WildFly-based builds use `module.xml` templates to generate the final `module.xml` files based on the distribution type selected: *thin* (when the JBoss module artifacts are loaded directly from the Maven repository at runtime) or *thick* (when the JBoss module artifacts are resolved and copied to the distribution directory at provisioning time).

For example, here is an excerpt from a `module.xml` template:

[source,xml]
----
<module xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.8" name="org.jboss.as.jmx">
    <properties>
        <property name="jboss.api" value="private"/>
    </properties>

    <exports>
        <exclude path="org/jboss/as/jmx/logging"/>
    </exports>

    <resources>
        <artifact name="${org.wildfly.core:wildfly-jmx}"/>
    </resources>

    <dependencies>
        <!-- skipped content -->
----

It looks pretty much like the final `module.xml` except that the artifact name is an epression which should be replaced with either the complete artifact coordinates in case of a thin distribution, e.g.
[source,xml]
----
<module name="org.jboss.as.jmx" xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.8">
    <properties>
        <property name="jboss.api" value="private"/>
    </properties>

    <exports>
        <exclude path="org/jboss/as/jmx/logging"/>
    </exports>

    <resources>
        <artifact name="org.wildfly.core:wildfly-jmx:5.0.0.Beta3-SNAPSHOT"/>
    </resources>

    <dependencies>
        <!-- skipped content -->
----
or the `resource-root` element in case of a thick distribution, e.g.

[source,xml]
----
<module name="org.jboss.as.jmx" xmlns="urn:jboss:module:1.8">
    <properties>
        <property name="jboss.api" value="private"/>
    </properties>

    <exports>
        <exclude path="org/jboss/as/jmx/logging"/>
    </exports>

    <resources>
        <resource-root path="wildfly-jmx-5.0.0.Beta3-SNAPSHOT.jar"/>
    </resources>

    <dependencies>
        <!-- skipped content -->
----

`module.xml` template processing is happening at provisioning time and depends on the kind of distribution being provisioned. The mojo creates a package per `module.xml` template and relfects the module dependencies as package dependencies.

NOTE: It is possible that a module depends on another module which is not found in the current feature-pack. In that case, the feature-pack that contains the package representing the module from the dependency must be declared as the dependency of the current feature-pack in the feature-pack build config file. If the dependency could not be resolved locally (among the modules included in the current feature-pack), the module will be looked up in the dependencies of the current feature-pack (in the order the dependencies are specified in the feature-pack build config file).

In case a module dependency could not be resolved neither locally nor in the feature-pack dependencies, an error will be thrown with the corresponding message.

##### modules.all package

If a feature-pack includes JBoss modules, in addition to the module packages, the mojo will generate a package called `modules.all`. This package will not contain any content but will simply depend on all the module packages generated for this feature-pack. This package exists for convenience only to be able to install all the modules from the feature-pack (and its dependencies) by including a single package.

NOTE: Original WildFly feature-packs include `modules.all` into the default package list at the moment to follow the legacy approach of building distributions. This is configured in the feature-pack build config file.
